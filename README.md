## The MSPM0trix: Segfaulted

Reality is a pointerâ€¦ and you just dereferenced NULL.

Welcome to The MSPM0trix: Segfaulted, a handheld first-person shooter where the only way out is through the systemâ€™s deepest vulnerabilities. Running on the MSPM0 microcontroller, this game turns embedded systems into battlegrounds, with PVP combat over UART and a retro-style 3D world.

Dodge enemy fire, navigate the simulation, and exploit every loophole in the codeâ€”because in this world, even one bad instruction could bring everything crashing down. Are you the debugger or just another broken process?

## ðŸ”¥ Features:
âœ… First-person shooter with a Matrix-inspired digital battlefield
